# Drive-Lite-Secure-PHP-File-Storage-and-Sharing-Portal
Drive Lite is a simple, self-hosted file storage and sharing portal built with PHP, MySQL, and PDO. It features secure user authentication (password hashing), secure file uploads outside the web root, private downloads for owners, and public sharing via unique, temporary tokens. A great project for mastering core PHP web best practices.
